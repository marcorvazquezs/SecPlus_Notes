# Social Engineering Techniques

**Social Engineering** - process of taking advantage of human behavior to attack a network or gain access to resources. Things like convincing or tricking people into giving up their passwords, phone numbers or other sensitive data.

## Techniques

**Tailgating**
- Piggybacking or following closely behind someone who has authorized physical access.

**Dumpster Diving**
- Finding sensitive information from the garbage without even having to come in contact with anyone in the organization
- Other sources of thrown away information:
  - Organization directories
  - Employee manuals
  - Hard drives and other media
  - Printer emails

- Companies need to have policies that requires shredding of all physical documents and secure wiping of all storage media

**Shoulder Surfing**
- Looking over someone's shoulder to gain information
- Think looking over their shoulder when they are typing their password or PIN number
  
**Phishing and Related Attacks**
- Classified as social engineering but these rely on technical methods
- These focus on asking for information that can then lead to sensitive data loss or compromise
- **Phishing**- trying to acquire sensitive information by pretending to be trustworthy, usually over email.
  - For protection, deploy proper security technologies and techniques on the client side, server side and enterprise level.
- **Related methods**
  - **Spear Phishing** - a targeted version of phishing, goes for a specific individual.
  - **Whaling** - just like spear phishing but targets high profile people, think company executives (CEO, CFO, etc.)
  - **Vishing** - also called voice phishing, use fake caller ID to try to trick people to give up information over the phone.
  - **Smishing** - uses SMS messages
  - **Pharming** - redirects victims from a legitimate site to a fake website. Usually in combination with techniques like DNS cache poisoning
- ***Credential Harvesting*** is a common goal of phishing campaigns, this simply means gathering usernames and passwords

**Watering Hole Attacks**
- Like spear phishing but instead of using email, the attacker attacks a site that the target often visits.
